    "From the first corse till he that died to-day,",
    "'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth",
    "This unprevailing woe, and think of us",
    "As of a father: for let the world take note,",
    "You are the most immediate to our throne;",

    "What said he?",
    "He took me by the wrist and held me hard;",
    "Then goes he to the length of all his arm;",
    "And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,",
    "He falls to such perusal of my face",
    "As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;",
    "At last, a little shaking of mine arm",
    "And thrice his head thus waving up and down,",
    "He raised a sigh so piteous and profound",
    "As it did seem to shatter all his bulk",
    "And end his being: that done, he lets me go:",
    "And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,",
    "He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;",
    "For out o' doors he went without their helps,",
    "And, to the last, bended their light on me.",
    "Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.",
    "This is the very ecstasy of love,",
    "Whose violent property fordoes itself",
    "And leads the will to desperate undertakings",
    "As oft as any passion under heaven",
    "That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.",
    "What, have you given him any hard words of late?",
    "No, my good lord, but, as you did command,",
    "I did repel his fetters and denied",
    "His access to me.",
    "That hath made him mad.",
    "I am sorry that with better heed and judgment",
    "I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,",
    "And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!",
    "By heaven, it is as proper to our age",
    "To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions",
    "As it is common for the younger sort",
    "To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:",

    "And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,",
    "That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court",
    "Some little time: so by your companies",
    "To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,",
    "So much as from occasion you may glean,",

    "That, open'd, lies within our remedy.",

    "His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd",
    "To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;",

    "It was against your highness: whereat grieved,",
    "That so his sickness, age and impotence",
    "Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests",
    "On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;",

    "Well, God-a-mercy.",
    "Do you know me, my lord?",
    "Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.",
    "Not I, my lord.",
    "Then I would you were so honest a man.",
    "Honest, my lord!",
    "Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be",
    "one man picked out of ten thousand.",
    "That's very true, my lord.",
    "For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a",
    "god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?",
    "I have, my lord.",
    "Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a",
    "blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.",
    "Friend, look to 't.",
    "[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my",
    "daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I",
    "was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and",
    "truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for",
    "love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.",
    "What do you read, my lord?",
    "Words, words, words.",
    "What is the matter, my lord?",
    "Between who?",
    "I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.",
    "Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here",
    "that old men have grey beards, that their faces are",
    "wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and",
    "plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of",
    "wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,",
    "though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet",
    "I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for",
    "yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab",
    "you could go backward.",
    "[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method",
    "in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?",
    "Into my grave.",
    "Indeed, that is out o' the air.",
    "Aside",
    "How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness",
    "that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity",
    "could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will",
    "leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of",
    "meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable",
    "lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.",
    "You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will",
    "more willingly part withal: except my life, except",
    "my life, except my life.",
    "Fare you well, my lord.",

    "As the indifferent children of the earth.",
    "Happy, in that we are not over-happy;",
    "On fortune's cap we are not the very button.",
    "Nor the soles of her shoe?",
    "Neither, my lord.",

    "her favours?",
    "'Faith, her privates we.",
    "In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she",
    "is a strumpet. What's the news?",
    "None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.",
    "Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.",
    "Let me question more in particular: what have you,",
    "my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,",
    "that she sends you to prison hither?",
    "Prison, my lord!",
    "Denmark's a prison.",
    "Then is the world one.",
    "A goodly one; in which there are many confines,",
    "wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.",
    "We think not so, my lord.",
    "Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing",
    "either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me",
    "it is a prison.",
    "Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too",
    "narrow for your mind.",
    "O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count",
    "myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I",
    "have bad dreams.",
    "Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very",
    "substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.",
    "A dream itself is but a shadow.",
    "Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a",
    "quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.",
    "Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and",
    "outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we",
    "to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.",
    "We'll wait upon you.",
    "No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest",
    "of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest",
    "man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the",
    "beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?",
    "To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.",
    "Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I",
    "thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are",
    "too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it",
    "your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,",
    "deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.",
    "What should we say, my lord?",
    "Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent",
    "for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks",
    "which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:",
    "I know the good king and queen have sent for you.",
    "To what end, my lord?",
    "That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by",
    "the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of",
    "our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved",
    "love, and by what more dear a better proposer could",
    "charge you withal, be even and direct with me,",
    "whether you were sent for, or no?",
    "[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?",
    "[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you",
    "love me, hold not off.",
    "My lord, we were sent for.",
    "I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation",
    "prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king",
    "and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but",
    "wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all",
    "custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily",
    "with my disposition that this goodly frame, the",
    "earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most",
    "excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave",
    "o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted",
    "with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to",
    "me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.",
    "What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!",
    "how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how",
    "express and admirable! in action how like an angel!",
    "in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the",
    "world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,",
    "what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not",
    "me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling",
    "you seem to say so.",
    "My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.",
    "Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?",
    "To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what",
    "lenten entertainment the players shall receive from",
    "you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they",
    "coming, to offer you service.",
    "He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty",
    "shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight",
    "shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not",
    "sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part",
    "in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose",
    "lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall",
    "say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt",
    "for't. What players are they?",
    "Even those you were wont to take delight in, the",
    "tragedians of the city.",
    "How chances it they travel? their residence, both",
    "in reputation and profit, was better both ways.",
    "I think their inhibition comes by the means of the",
    "late innovation.",
    "Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was",
    "in the city? are they so followed?",
    "No, indeed, are they not.",
    "How comes it? do they grow rusty?",
    "Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but",
    "there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,",
    "that cry out on the top of question, and are most",
    "tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the",
    "fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they",
    "call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of",
    "goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.",
    "What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are",
    "they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no",
    "longer than they can sing? will they not say",
    "afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common",
    "players--as it is most like, if their means are no",
    "better--their writers do them wrong, to make them",
    "exclaim against their own succession?",
    "'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and",
    "the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to",
    "controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid",
    "for argument, unless the poet and the player went to",
    "cuffs in the question.",
    "Is't possible?",
    "O, there has been much throwing about of brains.",
    "Do the boys carry it away?",
    "Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.",
    "It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of",
    "Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while",
    "my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an",

    "come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion",
    "and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,",
    "lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,",
    "must show fairly outward, should more appear like",
    "entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my",
    "uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.",
    "In what, my dear lord?",
    "I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is",

    "Enter POLONIUS",
    "Well be with you, gentlemen!",

    "Ay, my lord.",

    "Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.",
    "So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for",
    "I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two",

    "bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a",
    "fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the",
    "King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and",
    "makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes,",
    "comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried",
    "away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and",

    "Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense",
    "Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,",
    "Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd",
    "But it reserved some quantity of choice,",
    "To serve in such a difference. What devil was't",

    "Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love",
    "Over the nasty sty,--",
    "O, speak to me no more;",
    "These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;",
    "No more, sweet Hamlet!",
    "A murderer and a villain;",
    "A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe",
    "Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;",
    "A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,",
    "That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,",
    "And put it in his pocket!",
    "No more!",
    "A king of shreds and patches,--",
    "Enter Ghost",

    "We would not understand what was most fit;",
    "But, like the owner of a foul disease,",

    "Take you me for a sponge, my lord?",
    "Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his",
    "rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the",
    "king best service in the end: he keeps them, like",
    "an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to",
    "be last swallowed: when he needs what you have",
    "gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you",
    "shall be dry again.",
    "I understand you not, my lord.",
    "I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a",

    "My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go",
    "with us to the king.",

    "I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.",

    "He's loved of the distracted multitude,",
    "Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;",
    "And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,",

    "Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?",
    "At supper.",
    "At supper! where?",
    "Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain",
    "convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your",
    "worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all",
    "creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for",
    "maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but",
    "variable service, two dishes, but to one table:",
    "that's the end.",
    "Alas, alas!",
    "A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a",

    "Where is Polonius?",
    "In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger",

    "And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--",
    "As my great power thereof may give thee sense,",
    "Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red",
    "After the Danish sword, and thy free awe",
    "Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set",

    "By letters congruing to that effect,",
    "The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;",

    "Against some part of Poland.",
    "Who commands them, sir?",
    "The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.",
    "Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,",

    "Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,",
    "Looking before and after, gave us not",
    "That capability and god-like reason",
    "To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be",
    "Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple",
    "Of thinking too precisely on the event,",

    "As did that one, and that, in my regard,",
    "Of the unworthiest siege.",
    "What part is that, my lord?",
    "A very riband in the cap of youth,",
    "Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes",

    "Upon my life, Lamond.",
    "The very same.",

    "Now, out of this,--",
    "What out of this, my lord?",
    "Laertes, was your father dear to you?",
    "Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,",
    "A face without a heart?",
    "Why ask you this?",
    "Not that I think you did not love your father;",
    "But that I know love is begun by time;",
    "And that I see, in passages of proof,",
    "Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.",
    "There lives within the very flame of love",
    "A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;",
    "And nothing is at a like goodness still;",
    "For goodness, growing to a plurisy,",
    "Dies in his own too much: that we would do",
    "We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes",

    "The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together",
    "And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,",
    "Most generous and free from all contriving,",
    "Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,",
    "Or with a little shuffling, you may choose",
    "A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise",

    "Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;",
    "And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:",

    "that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.",
    "How long is that since?",
    "Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it",
    "was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that",
    "is mad, and sent into England.",
    "Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?",
    "Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits",
    "there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.",
    "Why?",
    "'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men",

    "I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we",

    "or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.",
    "Why he more than another?",
    "Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that",
    "he will keep out water a great while; and your water",

    "three and twenty years.",
    "Whose was it?",

    "Nay, I know not.",

    "Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,",
    "They had begun the play--I sat me down,",
    "Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:",
    "I once did hold it, as our statists do,",
    "A baseness to write fair and labour'd much",
    "How to forget that learning, but, sir, now",
    "It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know",
    "The effect of what I wrote?",
    "Ay, good my lord.",
    "An earnest conjuration from the king,",
    "As England was his faithful tributary,",
    "As love between them like the palm might flourish,",
    "As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear",
    "And stand a comma 'tween their amities,",
    "And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,",
    "That, on the view and knowing of these contents,",
    "Without debatement further, more or less,",
    "He should the bearers put to sudden death,",
    "Not shriving-time allow'd.",
    "How was this seal'd?",
    "Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.",
    "I had my father's signet in my purse,",
    "Which was the model of that Danish seal;",
    "Folded the writ up in form of the other,",
    "Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,",

    "Why, what a king is this!",
    "Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--",
    "He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,",
    "Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,",
    "Thrown out his angle for my proper life,",
    "And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,",

    "In further evil?",
    "It must be shortly known to him from England",
    "What is the issue of the business there.",
    "It will be short: the interim is mine;",
    "And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'",
    "But I am very sorry, good Horatio,",
    "That to Laertes I forgot myself;",
    "For, by the image of my cause, I see",
    "The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.",
    "But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me",
    "Into a towering passion.",
    "Peace! who comes here?",

    "Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.",
    "I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?",
    "No, my good lord.",
    "Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to",
    "know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a",
    "beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at",
    "the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,",
    "spacious in the possession of dirt.",
    "Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I",
    "should impart a thing to you from his majesty.",
    "I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of",
    "spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.",
    "I thank your lordship, it is very hot.",
    "No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is",
    "northerly.",
    "It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.",
    "But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my",
    "complexion.",
    "Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as",
    "'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his",
    "majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a",
    "great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--",
    "I beseech you, remember--",
    "HAMLET moves him to put on his hat",
    "Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.",
    "Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe",
    "me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent",
    "differences, of very soft society and great showing:",
    "indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or",
    "calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the",
    "continent of what part a gentleman would see.",
    "Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;",
    "though, I know, to divide him inventorially would",
    "dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw",
    "neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the",
    "verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of",
    "great article; and his infusion of such dearth and",
    "rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his",
    "semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace",
    "him, his umbrage, nothing more.",
    "Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.",
    "The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman",
    "in our more rawer breath?",
    "Sir?",
    "Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?",
    "You will do't, sir, really.",
    "What imports the nomination of this gentleman?",
    "Of Laertes?",
    "His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.",
    "Of him, sir.",
    "I know you are not ignorant--",
    "I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,",
    "it would not much approve me. Well, sir?",
    "You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--",
    "I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with",
    "him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to",
    "know himself.",
    "I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation",
    "laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.",
    "What's his weapon?",
    "Rapier and dagger.",
    "That's two of his weapons: but, well.",
    "The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary",
    "horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take",
    "it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their",
    "assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the",
    "carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very",
    "responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,",
    "and of very liberal conceit.",
    "What call you the carriages?",
    "I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.",
    "The carriages, sir, are the hangers.",
    "The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we",
    "could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might",
    "be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses",
    "against six French swords, their assigns, and three",
    "liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet",
    "against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?",
    "The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes",
    "between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you",
    "three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it",
    "would come to immediate trial, if your lordship",
    "would vouchsafe the answer.",
    "How if I answer 'no'?",
    "I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.",
    "Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his",
    "majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let",
    "the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the",
    "king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;",
    "if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.",
    "Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?",
    "To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.",
    "I commend my duty to your lordship.",
    "Yours, yours.",
    "Exit OSRIC",
    "He does well to commend it himself; there are no",
    "tongues else for's turn.",
    "This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.",
    "He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.",
    "Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I",
    "know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of",
    "the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of",
    "yesty collection, which carries them through and",
    "through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do",
    "but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.",
    "Enter a Lord",
    "My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young",

    "You will lose this wager, my lord.",
    "I do not think so: since he went into France, I",
    "have been in continual practise: I shall win at the",
    "odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here",
    "about my heart: but it is no matter.",
    "Nay, good my lord,--",
    "It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of",
    "gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.",
    "If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will",
    "forestall their repair hither, and say you are not",
    "fit.",

    "that the longer the time is, after the sight, or Sense of any object,",
    "the weaker is the Imagination. For the continuall change of mans body,",

    "The former, (which is the imagining the whole object, as it was",
    "presented to the sense) is Simple Imagination; as when one imagineth",
    "a man, or horse, which he hath seen before. The other is Compounded;",

    "Fancy hath no particular name; as being a thing that doth not",
    "commonly fall into mens discourse.",
    "Dreams",
    "The imaginations of them that sleep, are those we call Dreams.",
    "And these also (as all other Imaginations) have been before,",

    "the Brain, and Nerves, which are the necessary Organs of sense,",
    "are so benummed in sleep, as not easily to be moved by the action",
    "of Externall Objects, there can happen in sleep, no Imagination;",
    "and therefore no Dreame, but what proceeds from the agitation of",
    "the inward parts of mans body; which inward parts, for the connexion",
    "they have with the Brayn, and other Organs, when they be distempered,",
    "do keep the same in motion; whereby the Imaginations there formerly made,",
    "appeare as if a man were waking; saving that the Organs of Sense",
    "being now benummed, so as there is no new object, which can master",
    "and obscure them with a more vigorous impression, a Dreame must needs",
    "be more cleare, in this silence of sense, than are our waking thoughts.",
    "And hence it cometh to pass, that it is a hard matter, and by many",
    "thought impossible to distinguish exactly between Sense and Dreaming.",
    "For my part, when I consider, that in Dreames, I do not often,",
    "nor constantly think of the same Persons, Places, Objects, and Actions that",
    "I do waking; nor remember so long a trayne of coherent thoughts, Dreaming,",
    "as at other times; And because waking I often observe the absurdity",
    "of Dreames, but never dream of the absurdities of my waking Thoughts;",
    "I am well satisfied, that being awake, I know I dreame not;",
    "though when I dreame, I think my selfe awake.",
    "And seeing dreames are caused by the distemper of some of the inward",
    "parts of the Body; divers distempers must needs cause different Dreams.",
    "And hence it is, that lying cold breedeth Dreams of Feare,",
    "and raiseth the thought and Image of some fearfull object",
    "(the motion from the brain to the inner parts, and from the",
    "inner parts to the Brain being reciprocall:) and that as Anger",
    "causeth heat in some parts of the Body, when we are awake;",
    "so when we sleep, the over heating of the same parts causeth Anger,",
    "and raiseth up in the brain the Imagination of an Enemy.",
    "In the same manner; as naturall kindness, when we are awake",
    "causeth desire; and desire makes heat in certain other parts",
    "of the body; so also, too much heat in those parts, while wee sleep,",
    "raiseth in the brain an imagination of some kindness shewn.",

    "and whose conscience is much troubled; and that sleepeth,",
    "without the circumstances, of going to bed, or putting off his clothes,",
    "as one that noddeth in a chayre. For he that taketh pains,",
    "and industriously layes himselfe to sleep, in case any uncouth and",
    "exorbitant fancy come unto him, cannot easily think it other than a Dream.",
    "We read of Marcus Brutes, (one that had his life given him by Julius",
    "Caesar, and was also his favorite, and notwithstanding murthered him,)",
    "how at Phillipi, the night before he gave battell to Augustus Caesar,",
    "he saw a fearfull apparition, which is commonly related by Historians",
    "as a Vision: but considering the circumstances, one may easily judge",
    "to have been but a short Dream. For sitting in his tent, pensive and",
    "troubled with the horrour of his rash act, it was not hard for him,",
    "slumbering in the cold, to dream of that which most affrighted him;",
    "which feare, as by degrees it made him wake; so also it must needs make",
    "the Apparition by degrees to vanish: And having no assurance that he slept,",
    "he could have no cause to think it a Dream, or any thing but a Vision.",
    "And this is no very rare Accident: for even they that be perfectly awake,",
    "if they be timorous, and supperstitious, possessed with fearfull tales,",
    "and alone in the dark, are subject to the like fancies, and believe",
    "they see spirits and dead mens Ghosts walking in Churchyards;",
    "whereas it is either their Fancy onely, or els the knavery of such persons,",
    "as make use of such superstitious feare, to pass disguised in the night,",
    "to places they would not be known to haunt.",
    "From this ignorance of how to distinguish Dreams, and other strong Fancies,",
    "from vision and Sense, did arise the greatest part of the Religion of",
    "the Gentiles in time past, that worshipped Satyres, Fawnes, nymphs,",
    "and the like; and now adayes the opinion than rude people have of Fayries,",
    "Ghosts, and Goblins; and of the power of Witches. For as for Witches,",
    "I think not that their witch craft is any reall power; but yet that",
    "they are justly punished, for the false beliefe they have, that they can",
    "do such mischiefe, joyned with their purpose to do it if they can;",
    "their trade being neerer to a new Religion, than to a Craft or Science.",
    "And for Fayries, and walking Ghosts, the opinion of them has I think been",
    "on purpose, either taught, or not confuted, to keep in credit the use",
    "of Exorcisme, of Crosses, of holy Water, and other such inventions",
    "of Ghostly men. Neverthelesse, there is no doubt, but God can make",
    "unnaturall Apparitions. But that he does it so often, as men need",
    "to feare such things, more than they feare the stay, or change,",
    "of the course of Nature, which he also can stay, and change,",
    "is no point of Christian faith. But evill men under pretext",
    "that God can do any thing, are so bold as to say any thing",
    "when it serves their turn, though they think it untrue; It is the part",
    "of a wise man, to believe them no further, than right reason makes",
    "that which they say, appear credible. If this superstitious fear",
    "of Spirits were taken away, and with it, Prognostiques from Dreams,",
    "false Prophecies, and many other things depending thereon, by which,",
    "crafty ambitious persons abuse the simple people, men would be much",
    "more fitted than they are for civill Obedience.",
    "And this ought to be the work of the Schooles; but they rather nourish",
    "such doctrine. For (not knowing what Imagination, or the Senses are),",
    "what they receive, they teach: some saying, that Imaginations rise",
    "of themselves, and have no cause: Others that they rise most commonly",
    "from the Will; and that Good thoughts are blown (inspired) into a man,",
    "by God; and evill thoughts by the Divell: or that Good thoughts are",
    "powred (infused) into a man, by God; and evill ones by the Divell.",

    "to another, as in a Dream. Such are Commonly the thoughts of men,",
    "that are not onely without company, but also without care of any thing;",
    "though even then their Thoughts are as busie as at other times,",
    "but without harmony; as the sound which a Lute out of tune would yeeld",
    "to any man; or in tune, to one that could not play. And yet in this",
    "wild ranging of the mind, a man may oft-times perceive the way of it,",
    "and the dependance of one thought upon another. For in a Discourse",
    "of our present civill warre, what could seem more impertinent,",
    "than to ask (as one did) what was the value of a Roman Penny?",
    "Yet the Cohaerence to me was manifest enough. For the Thought of the",
    "warre, introduced the Thought of the delivering up the King to his Enemies;",
    "The Thought of that, brought in the Thought of the delivering up of Christ;",
    "and that again the Thought of the 30 pence, which was the price",
    "of that treason: and thence easily followed that malicious question;",
    "and all this in a moment of time; for Thought is quick.",
    "Trayne Of Thoughts Regulated",
    "The second is more constant; as being Regulated by some desire,",
    "and designee. For the impression made by such things as wee desire,",
    "or feare, is strong, and permanent, or, (if it cease for a time,) of",
    "quick return: so strong it is sometimes, as to hinder and break our sleep.",
    "From Desire, ariseth the Thought of some means we have seen produce",
    "the like of that which we ayme at; and from the thought of that,",
    "the thought of means to that mean; and so continually, till we come",
    "to some beginning within our own power. And because the End,",
    "by the greatnesse of the impression, comes often to mind, in case our",
    "thoughts begin to wander, they are quickly again reduced into the way:",
    "which observed by one of the seven wise men, made him give men",
    "this praecept, which is now worne out, Respice Finem; that is to say,",
    "in all your actions, look often upon what you would have, as the thing",
    "that directs all your thoughts in the way to attain it.",
    "Remembrance",
    "The Trayn of regulated Thoughts is of two kinds; One, when of",
    "an effect imagined, wee seek the causes, or means that produce it:",
    "and this is common to Man and Beast. The other is, when imagining",
    "any thing whatsoever, wee seek all the possible effects, that can",
    "by it be produced; that is to say, we imagine what we can do with it,",
    "when wee have it. Of which I have not at any time seen any signe,",
    "but in man onely; for this is a curiosity hardly incident to the",
    "nature of any living creature that has no other Passion but sensuall,",
    "such as are hunger, thirst, lust, and anger. In summe, the Discourse",
    "of the Mind, when it is governed by designee, is nothing but Seeking,",
    "or the faculty of Invention, which the Latines call Sagacitas,",
    "and Solertia; a hunting out of the causes, of some effect,",
    "present or past; or of the effects, of some present or past cause.",
    "sometimes a man seeks what he hath lost; and from that place, and time,",
    "wherein hee misses it, his mind runs back, from place to place,",
    "and time to time, to find where, and when he had it; that is to say,",
    "to find some certain, and limited time and place, in which to begin",
    "a method of seeking. Again, from thence, his thoughts run over",
    "the same places and times, to find what action, or other occasion",
    "might make him lose it. This we call Remembrance, or Calling to mind:",
    "the Latines call it Reminiscentia, as it were a Re-Conning",
    "of our former actions.",
    "Sometimes a man knows a place determinate, within the compasse whereof",
    "his is to seek; and then his thoughts run over all the parts thereof,",
    "in the same manner, as one would sweep a room, to find a jewell;",
    "or as a Spaniel ranges the field, till he find a sent; or as a man",
    "should run over the alphabet, to start a rime.",
    "Prudence",
    "Sometime a man desires to know the event of an action; and then",
    "he thinketh of some like action past, and the events thereof",
    "one after another; supposing like events will follow like actions.",
    "As he that foresees what wil become of a Criminal, re-cons what he has",
    "seen follow on the like Crime before; having this order of thoughts,",
    "The Crime, the Officer, the Prison, the Judge, and the Gallowes.",
    "Which kind of thoughts, is called Foresight, and Prudence,",
    "or Providence; and sometimes Wisdome; though such conjecture,",
    "through the difficulty of observing all circumstances, be very fallacious.",
    "But this is certain; by how much one man has more experience of",
    "things past, than another; by so much also he is more Prudent,",
    "and his expectations the seldomer faile him. The Present onely",
    "has a being in Nature; things Past have a being in the Memory onely,",
    "but things To Come have no being at all; the Future being but a",
    "fiction of the mind, applying the sequels of actions Past,",
    "to the actions that are Present; which with most certainty is done",
    "by him that has most Experience; but not with certainty enough.",
    "And though it be called Prudence, when the Event answereth our Expectation;",
    "yet in its own nature, it is but Presumption. For the foresight",
    "of things to come, which is Providence, belongs onely to him",
    "by whose will they are to come. From him onely, and supernaturally,",
    "proceeds Prophecy. The best Prophet naturally is the best guesser;",
    "and the best guesser, he that is most versed and studied in the matters",
    "he guesses at: for he hath most Signes to guesse by.",
    "Signes",
    "A Signe, is the Event Antecedent, of the Consequent; and contrarily,",
    "the Consequent of the Antecedent, when the like Consequences have",
    "been observed, before: And the oftner they have been observed,",
    "the lesse uncertain is the Signe. And therefore he that has most",
    "experience in any kind of businesse, has most Signes, whereby to guesse at",
    "the Future time, and consequently is the most prudent: And so much more",
    "prudent than he that is new in that kind of business, as not to",
    "be equalled by any advantage of naturall and extemporary wit:",
    "though perhaps many young men think the contrary.",
    "Neverthelesse it is not Prudence that distinguisheth man from beast.",
    "There be beasts, that at a year old observe more, and pursue that which",
    "is for their good, more prudently, than a child can do at ten.",
    "Conjecture Of The Time Past",
    "As Prudence is a Praesumtion of the Future, contracted from",
    "the Experience of time Past; So there is a Praesumtion of things Past",
    "taken from other things (not future but) past also. For he that hath",
    "seen by what courses and degrees, a flourishing State hath first come",
    "into civill warre, and then to ruine; upon the sights of the ruines",
    "of any other State, will guesse, the like warre, and the like courses",
    "have been there also. But his conjecture, has the same incertainty",
    "almost with the conjecture of the Future; both being grounded",
    "onely upon Experience.",
    "There is no other act of mans mind, that I can remember, naturally",
    "planted in him, so, as to need no other thing, to the exercise of it,",
    "but to be born a man, and live with the use of his five Senses.",
    "Those other Faculties, of which I shall speak by and by, and which",
    "seem proper to man onely, are acquired, and encreased by study and",
    "industry; and of most men learned by instruction, and discipline;",
    "and proceed all from the invention of Words, and Speech. For besides",
    "Sense, and Thoughts, and the Trayne of thoughts, the mind of man",
    "has no other motion; though by the help of Speech, and Method,",
    "the same Facultyes may be improved to such a height, as to",
    "distinguish men from all other living Creatures.",
    "Whatsoever we imagine, is Finite. Therefore there is no Idea,",
    "or conception of anything we call Infinite. No man can have in",
    "his mind an Image of infinite magnitude; nor conceive the ends,",
    "and bounds of the thing named; having no Conception of the thing,",
    "but of our own inability. And therefore the Name of GOD is used,",
    "not to make us conceive him; (for he is Incomprehensible; and his",
    "greatnesse, and power are unconceivable;) but that we may honour him.",
    "Also because whatsoever (as I said before,) we conceive, has been perceived",
    "first by sense, either all at once, or by parts; a man can have no thought,",
    "representing any thing, not subject to sense. No man therefore",
    "can conceive any thing, but he must conceive it in some place;",
    "and indued with some determinate magnitude; and which may be divided",
    "into parts; nor that any thing is all in this place, and all in another",
    "place at the same time; nor that two, or more things can be in one,",
    "and the same place at once: for none of these things ever have,",
    "or can be incident to Sense; but are absurd speeches, taken upon credit",
    "(without any signification at all,) from deceived Philosophers,",
    "and deceived, or deceiving Schoolemen.",
    "Originall Of Speech",
    "The Invention of Printing, though ingenious, compared with the",
    "invention of Letters, is no great matter. But who was the first that",
    "found the use of Letters, is not known. He that first brought them into",
    "Greece, men say was Cadmus, the sonne of Agenor, King of Phaenicia.",
    "A profitable Invention for continuing the memory of time past,",
    "and the conjunction of mankind, dispersed into so many, and distant",
    "regions of the Earth; and with all difficult, as proceeding from a",
    "watchfull observation of the divers motions of the Tongue, Palat,",
    "Lips, and other organs of Speech; whereby to make as many differences",
    "of characters, to remember them. But the most noble and profitable",
    "invention of all other, was that of Speech, consisting of Names or",
    "Apellations, and their Connexion; whereby men register their Thoughts;",
    "recall them when they are past; and also declare them one to another",
    "for mutuall utility and conversation; without which, there had been",
    "amongst men, neither Common-wealth, nor Society, nor Contract, nor Peace,",
    "no more than amongst Lyons, Bears, and Wolves. The first author",
    "of Speech was GOD himselfe, that instructed Adam how to name such",
    "creatures as he presented to his sight; For the Scripture goeth",
    "no further in this matter. But this was sufficient to direct him",
    "to adde more names, as the experience and use of the creatures should",
    "give him occasion; and to joyn them in such manner by degrees,",
    "as to make himselfe understood; and so by succession of time,",
    "so much language might be gotten, as he had found use for;",
    "though not so copious, as an Orator or Philosopher has need of.",
    "For I do not find any thing in the Scripture, out of which,",
    "directly or by consequence can be gathered, that Adam was taught",
    "the names of all Figures, Numbers, Measures, Colours, Sounds, Fancies,",
    "Relations; much less the names of Words and Speech, as Generall, Speciall, Affirmative, Negative, Interrogative, Optative, Infinitive,",
    "",
    "all which are usefull; and least of all, of Entity, Intentionality,",
    "Quiddity, and other significant words of the School.",
    "But all this language gotten, and augmented by Adam and his posterity,",
    "was again lost at the tower of Babel, when by the hand of God, every man",
    "was stricken for his rebellion, with an oblivion of his former language.",
    "And being hereby forced to disperse themselves into severall parts",
    "of the world, it must needs be, that the diversity of Tongues that",
    "now is, proceeded by degrees from them, in such manner, as need",
    "(the mother of all inventions) taught them; and in tract of time",
    "grew every where more copious.",
    "The Use Of Speech",
    "The generall use of Speech, is to transferre our Mentall Discourse,",
    "into Verbal; or the Trayne of our Thoughts, into a Trayne of Words;",
    "and that for two commodities; whereof one is, the Registring of the",
    "Consequences of our Thoughts; which being apt to slip out of our memory,",
    "and put us to a new labour, may again be recalled, by such words",
    "as they were marked by. So that the first use of names, is to serve",
    "for Markes, or Notes of remembrance. Another is, when many use",
    "the same words, to signifie (by their connexion and order,)",
    "one to another, what they conceive, or think of each matter;",
    "and also what they desire, feare, or have any other passion for.",
    "and for this use they are called Signes. Speciall uses of Speech",
    "are these; First, to Register, what by cogitation, wee find to be",
    "the cause of any thing, present or past; and what we find things present",
    "or past may produce, or effect: which in summe, is acquiring of Arts.",
    "Secondly, to shew to others that knowledge which we have attained;",
    "which is, to Counsell, and Teach one another. Thirdly, to make known",
    "to others our wills, and purposes, that we may have the mutuall help",
    "of one another. Fourthly, to please and delight our selves, and others,",
    "by playing with our words, for pleasure or ornament, innocently.",
    "Abuses Of Speech",
    "To these Uses, there are also foure correspondent Abuses.",
    "First, when men register their thoughts wrong, by the inconstancy",
    "of the signification of their words; by which they register for their",
    "conceptions, that which they never conceived; and so deceive themselves.",
    "Secondly, when they use words metaphorically; that is, in other sense",
    "than that they are ordained for; and thereby deceive others.",
    "Thirdly, when by words they declare that to be their will, which is not.",
    "Fourthly, when they use them to grieve one another: for seeing nature",
    "hath armed living creatures, some with teeth, some with horns,",
    "and some with hands, to grieve an enemy, it is but an abuse of Speech,",
    "to grieve him with the tongue, unlesse it be one whom wee are obliged",
    "to govern; and then it is not to grieve, but to correct and amend.",
    "The manner how Speech serveth to the remembrance of the consequence",
    "of causes and effects, consisteth in the imposing of Names,",
    "and the Connexion of them.",
    "Names Proper & Common",
    "Universall",
    "Of Names, some are Proper, and singular to one onely thing; as Peter,",
    "John, This Man, This Tree: and some are Common to many things;",
    "as Man, Horse, Tree; every of which though but one Name,",
    "is nevertheless the name of divers particular things; in respect of",
    "all which together, it is called an Universall; there being nothing",
    "in the world Universall but Names; for the things named, are every one",
    "of them Individual and Singular.",
    "One Universall name is imposed on many things, for their similitude",
    "in some quality, or other accident: And whereas a Proper Name",
    "bringeth to mind one thing onely; Universals recall any one of those many.",
    "And of Names Universall, some are of more, and some of lesse extent;",
    "the larger comprehending the lesse large: and some again of equall extent,",
    "comprehending each other reciprocally. As for example, the Name Body",
    "is of larger signification than the word Man, and conprehendeth it;",
    "and the names Man and Rationall, are of equall extent, comprehending",
    "mutually one another. But here wee must take notice, that by a Name",
    "is not alwayes understood, as in Grammar, one onely word; but sometimes",
    "by circumlocution many words together. For all these words,",
    "Hee That In His Actions Observeth The Lawes Of His Country,",
    "make but one Name, equivalent to this one word, Just.",
    "By this imposition of Names, some of larger, some of stricter",
    "signification, we turn the reckoning of the consequences of",
    "things imagined in the mind, into a reckoning of the consequences",
    "of Appellations. For example, a man that hath no use of Speech",
    "at all, (such, as is born and remains perfectly deafe and dumb,)",
    "if he set before his eyes a triangle, and by it two right angles,",
    "(such as are the corners of a square figure,) he may by meditation",
    "compare and find, that the three angles of that triangle, are equall",
    "to those two right angles that stand by it. But if another triangle",
    "be shewn him different in shape from the former, he cannot know",
    "without a new labour, whether the three angles of that also be",
    "equall to the same. But he that hath the use of words, when he observes,",
    "that such equality was consequent, not to the length of the sides,",
    "nor to any other particular thing in his triangle; but onely to this,",
    "that the sides were straight, and the angles three; and that that was all,",
    "for which he named it a Triangle; will boldly conclude Universally,",
    "that such equality of angles is in all triangles whatsoever;",
    "and register his invention in these generall termes, Every Triangle Hath",
    "Its Three Angles Equall To Two Right Angles. And thus the consequence",
    "found in one particular, comes to be registred and remembred,",
    "as a Universall rule; and discharges our mentall reckoning,",
    "of time and place; and delivers us from all labour of the mind,",
    "saving the first; and makes that which was found true Here, and Now,",
    "to be true in All Times and Places.",
    "But the use of words in registring our thoughts, is in nothing",
    "so evident as in Numbering. A naturall foole that could never learn",
    "by heart the order of numerall words, as One, Two, and Three,",
    "may observe every stroak of the Clock, and nod to it, or say one,",
    "one, one; but can never know what houre it strikes. And it seems,",
    "there was a time when those names of number were not in use;",
    "and men were fayn to apply their fingers of one or both hands,",
    "to those things they desired to keep account of; and that thence",
    "it proceeded, that now our numerall words are but ten, in any Nation,",
    "and in some but five, and then they begin again. And he that",
    "can tell ten, if he recite them out of order, will lose himselfe,",
    "and not know when he has done: Much lesse will he be able to add,",
    "and substract, and performe all other operations of Arithmetique.",
    "So that without words, there is no possibility of reckoning of Numbers;",
    "much lesse of Magnitudes, of Swiftnesse, of Force, and other things,",
    "the reckonings whereof are necessary to the being, or well-being",
    "of man-kind.",
    "When two Names are joyned together into a Consequence, or Affirmation;",
    "as thus, A Man Is A Living Creature; or thus, If He Be A Man,",
    "He Is A Living Creature, If the later name Living Creature,",
    "signifie all that the former name Man signifieth, then the affirmation,",
    "or consequence is True; otherwise False. For True and False are",
    "attributes of Speech, not of things. And where Speech in not,",
    "there is neither Truth nor Falshood. Errour there may be,",
    "as when wee expect that which shall not be; or suspect what has not been:",
    "but in neither case can a man be charged with Untruth.",
    "Seeing then that Truth consisteth in the right ordering of names",
    "in our affirmations, a man that seeketh precise Truth, had need to",
    "remember what every name he uses stands for; and to place it accordingly;",
    "or els he will find himselfe entangled in words, as a bird in lime-twiggs;",
    "the more he struggles, the more belimed. And therefore in Geometry,",
    "(which is the onely Science that it hath pleased God hitherto to bestow",
    "on mankind,) men begin at settling the significations of their words;",
    "which settling of significations, they call Definitions; and place them",
    "in the beginning of their reckoning.",
    "By this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires",
    "to true Knowledge, to examine the Definitions of former Authors;",
    "and either to correct them, where they are negligently set down;",
    "or to make them himselfe. For the errours of Definitions multiply",
    "themselves, according as the reckoning proceeds; and lead men into",
    "absurdities, which at last they see, but cannot avoyd, without reckoning",
    "anew from the beginning; in which lyes the foundation of their errours.",
    "From whence it happens, that they which trust to books, do as they",
    "that cast up many little summs into a greater, without considering",
    "whether those little summes were rightly cast up or not; and at last",
    "finding the errour visible, and not mistrusting their first grounds,",
    "know not which way to cleere themselves; but spend time in fluttering",
    "over their bookes; as birds that entring by the chimney, and finding",
    "themselves inclosed in a chamber, flitter at the false light of",
    "a glasse window, for want of wit to consider which way they came in.",
    "So that in the right Definition of Names, lyes the first use of Speech;",
    "which is the Acquisition of Science: And in wrong, or no Definitions'",
    "lyes the first abuse; from which proceed all false and senslesse Tenets;",
    "which make those men that take their instruction from the authority",
    "of books, and not from their own meditation, to be as much below the",
    "condition of ignorant men, as men endued with true Science are above it.",
    "For between true Science, and erroneous Doctrines, Ignorance is in",
    "the middle. Naturall sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity.",
    "Nature it selfe cannot erre: and as men abound in copiousnesse of language;",
    "so they become more wise, or more mad than ordinary. Nor is it possible",
    "without Letters for any man to become either excellently wise, or",
    "(unless his memory be hurt by disease, or ill constitution of organs)",
    "excellently foolish. For words are wise mens counters, they do but",
    "reckon by them: but they are the mony of fooles, that value them by",
    "the authority of an Aristotle, a Cicero, or a Thomas, or any other",
    "Doctor whatsoever, if but a man.",
    "Subject To Names",
    "Subject To Names, is whatsoever can enter into, or be considered",
    "in an account; and be added one to another to make a summe;",
    "or substracted one from another, and leave a remainder. The Latines",
    "called Accounts of mony Rationes, and accounting, Ratiocinatio:",
    "and that which we in bills or books of account call Items,",
    "they called Nomina; that is, Names: and thence it seems to proceed,",
    "that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in",
    "all other things. The Greeks have but one word Logos, for both Speech",
    "and Reason; not that they thought there was no Speech without Reason;",
    "but no Reasoning without Speech: And the act of reasoning they called",
    "syllogisme; which signifieth summing up of the consequences of",
    "one saying to another. And because the same things may enter into",
    "account for divers accidents; their names are (to shew that diversity)",
    "diversly wrested, and diversified. This diversity of names may be",
    "reduced to foure generall heads.",
    "First, a thing may enter into account for Matter, or Body; as Living,",
    "Sensible, Rationall, Hot, Cold, Moved, Quiet; with all which names",
    "the word Matter, or Body is understood; all such, being names of Matter.",
    "Secondly, it may enter into account, or be considered, for some",
    "accident or quality, which we conceive to be in it; as for Being Moved,",
    "for Being So Long, for Being Hot, &c; and then, of the name of",
    "the thing it selfe, by a little change or wresting, wee make a name",
    "for that accident, which we consider; and for Living put into account",
    "Life; for Moved, Motion; for Hot, Heat; for Long, Length, and the like.",
    "And all such Names, are the names of the accidents and properties,",
    "by which one Matter, and Body is distinguished from another.",
    "These are called Names Abstract; Because Severed (not from Matter, but)",
    "from the account of Matter.",
    "Thirdly, we bring into account, the Properties of our own bodies,",
    "whereby we make such distinction: as when any thing is Seen by us,",
    "we reckon not the thing it selfe; but the Sight, the Colour, the Idea",
    "of it in the fancy: and when any thing is Heard, wee reckon it not;",
    "but the Hearing, or Sound onely, which is our fancy or conception",
    "of it by the Eare: and such are names of fancies.",
    "Fourthly, we bring into account, consider, and give names,",
    "to Names themselves, and to Speeches: For, Generall, Universall,",
    "Speciall, Oequivocall, are names of Names. And Affirmation,",
    "Interrogation, Commandement, Narration, Syllogisme, Sermon, Oration,",
    "and many other such, are names of Speeches.",
    "Use Of Names Positive",
    "And this is all the variety of Names Positive; which are put to mark",
    "somewhat which is in Nature, or may be feigned by the mind of man,",
    "as Bodies that are, or may be conceived to be; or of bodies,",
    "the Properties that are, or may be feigned to be; or Words and Speech.",
    "Negative Names With Their Uses.",
    "There be also other Names, called Negative; which are notes to signifie",
    "that a word is not the name of the thing in question; as these words",
    "Nothing, No Man, Infinite, Indocible, Three Want Foure, and the like;",
    "which are nevertheless of use in reckoning, or in correcting of reckoning;",
    "and call to mind our past cogitations, though they be not names of",
    "any thing; because they make us refuse to admit of Names not rightly used.",
    "Words Insignificant",
    "All other names, are but insignificant sounds; and those of two sorts.",
    "One, when they are new, and yet their meaning not explained by Definition;",
    "whereof there have been aboundance coyned by Schoole-men,",
    "and pusled Philosophers.",
    "Another, when men make a name of two Names, whose significations",
    "are contradictory and inconsistent; as this name, an Incorporeall Body,",
    "or (which is all one) an Incorporeall Substance, and a great number more.",
    "For whensoever any affirmation is false, the two names of which",
    "it is composed, put together and made one, signifie nothing at all.",
    "For example if it be a false affirmation to say A Quadrangle Is Round,",
    "the word Round Quadrangle signifies nothing; but is a meere sound.",
    "So likewise if it be false, to say that vertue can be powred,",

    "When a man upon the hearing of any Speech, hath those thoughts",
    "which the words of that Speech, and their connexion, were ordained",

    "Understanding being nothing els, but conception caused by Speech.",
    "And therefore if Speech be peculiar to man (as for ought I know it is,)",

    "are imposed to signifie our conceptions; and all our affections",

    "that we conceive, be the same; yet the diversity of our reception of it,",
    "in respect of different constitutions of body, and prejudices of opinion,",
    "gives everything a tincture of our different passions. And therefore",
    "in reasoning, a man bust take heed of words; which besides the",
    "signification of what we imagine of their nature, disposition,",
    "and interest of the speaker; such as are the names of Vertues,",

    "part, to the name of the other part. And though in some things,",
    "(as in numbers,) besides Adding and Substracting, men name other",
    "operations, as Multiplying and Dividing; yet they are the same;",
    "for Multiplication, is but Addition together of things equall;",

    "These operations are not incident to Numbers onely, but to",
    "all manner of things that can be added together, and taken",
    "one out of another. For as Arithmeticians teach to adde and",
    "substract in Numbers; so the Geometricians teach the same in Lines,",
    "Figures (solid and superficiall,) Angles, Proportions, Times,",
    "degrees of Swiftnesse, Force, Power, and the like; The Logicians",
    "teach the same in Consequences Of Words; adding together Two Names,",

    "and Many syllogismes to make a Demonstration; and from the Summe,",
    "or Conclusion of a syllogisme, they substract one Proposition,",
    "to finde the other. Writers of Politiques, adde together Pactions,",
    "to find mens Duties; and Lawyers, Lawes and Facts, to find what",

    "is nothing but Reckoning (that is, Adding and Substracting) of the",
    "Consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the Marking and",

    "signification, and fall upon a generall inference which is false;",
    "though it be commonly called Error, it is indeed an ABSURDITY,",
    "or senseless Speech. For Error is but a deception, in presuming",
    "that somewhat is past, or to come; of which, though it were not past,",
    "or not to come; yet there was no impossibility discoverable.",

    "the possibility of it is unconceivable. And words whereby",

    "Deliberation",
    "When in the mind of man, Appetites and Aversions, Hopes and Feares,",
    "concerning one and the same thing, arise alternately; and divers good",
    "and evill consequences of the doing, or omitting the thing propounded,",
    "come successively into our thoughts; so that sometimes we have an",
    "Appetite to it, sometimes an Aversion from it; sometimes Hope to be",
    "able to do it; sometimes Despaire, or Feare to attempt it; the whole sum",
    "of Desires, Aversions, Hopes and Feares, continued till the thing be",
    "either done, or thought impossible, is that we call DELIBERATION.",
    "Therefore of things past, there is no Deliberation; because",
    "manifestly impossible to be changed: nor of things known to",
    "be impossible, or thought so; because men know, or think such",
    "Deliberation vaine. But of things impossible, which we think possible,",
    "we may Deliberate; not knowing it is in vain. And it is called",
    "DELIBERATION; because it is a putting an end to the Liberty we had",
    "of doing, or omitting, according to our own Appetite, or Aversion.",
    "This alternate succession of Appetites, Aversions, Hopes and Feares",
    "is no less in other living Creatures than in Man; and therefore",
    "Beasts also Deliberate.",
    "Every Deliberation is then sayd to End when that whereof they",
    "Deliberate, is either done, or thought impossible; because till then",
    "wee retain the liberty of doing, or omitting, according to our",
    "Appetite, or Aversion.",
    "The Will",
    "In Deliberation, the last Appetite, or Aversion, immediately",
    "adhaering to the action, or to the omission thereof, is that",
    "wee call the WILL; the Act, (not the faculty,) of Willing.",
    "And Beasts that have Deliberation must necessarily also have Will.",
    "The Definition of the Will, given commonly by the Schooles,",
    "that it is a Rationall Appetite, is not good. For if it were,",
    "then could there be no Voluntary Act against Reason. For a Voluntary Act",
    "is that, which proceedeth from the Will, and no other. But if in stead",
    "of a Rationall Appetite, we shall say an Appetite resulting from",
    "a precedent Deliberation, then the Definition is the same that I",
    "have given here. Will, therefore, Is The Last Appetite In Deliberating.",
    "And though we say in common Discourse, a man had a Will once to",
    "do a thing, that neverthelesse he forbore to do; yet that is",
    "properly but an Inclination, which makes no Action Voluntary;",
    "because the action depends not of it, but of the last Inclination,",
    "or Appetite. For if the intervenient Appetites make any action Voluntary,",
    "then by the same reason all intervenient Aversions should make",
    "the same action Involuntary; and so one and the same action should be",
    "both Voluntary & Involuntary.",
    "By this it is manifest, that not onely actions that have their",
    "beginning from Covetousness, Ambition, Lust, or other Appetites",
    "to the thing propounded; but also those that have their beginning",
    "from Aversion, or Feare of those consequences that follow the omission,",
    "are Voluntary Actions.",
    "Formes Of Speech, In Passion",
    "The formes of Speech by which the Passions are expressed,",
    "are partly the same, and partly different from those, by which we",
    "express our Thoughts. And first generally all Passions may be",
    "expressed Indicatively; as, I Love, I Feare, I Joy, I Deliberate,",
    "I Will, I Command: but some of them have particular expressions",
    "by themselves, which nevertheless are not affirmations, unless it be",
    "when they serve to make other inferences, besides that of the Passion",
    "they proceed from. Deliberation is expressed Subjunctively;",
    "which is a speech proper to signifie suppositions, with their",
    "consequences; as, If This Be Done, Then This Will Follow;",
    "and differs not from the language of Reasoning, save that",
    "Reasoning is in generall words, but Deliberation for the most part",
    "is of Particulars. The language of Desire, and Aversion,",
    "is Imperative; as, Do This, Forbear That; which when the party",
    "is obliged to do, or forbear, is Command; otherwise Prayer;",
    "or els Counsell. The language of Vaine-Glory, of Indignation,",
    "Pitty and Revengefulness, Optative: but of the Desire to know,",
    "there is a peculiar expression called Interrogative; as, What Is It,",
    "When Shall It, How Is It Done, and Why So? Other language of",
    "the Passions I find none: for Cursing, Swearing, Reviling, and the like,",
    "do not signifie as Speech; but as the actions of a tongue accustomed.",
    "These forms of Speech, I say, are expressions, or voluntary",
    "significations of our Passions: but certain signes they be not;",
    "because they may be used arbitrarily, whether they that use them,",
    "have such Passions or not. The best signes of Passions present,",
    "are either in the countenance, motions of the body, actions,",
    "and ends, or aims, which we otherwise know the man to have.",
    "Good And Evill Apparent",
    "And because in Deliberation the Appetites and Aversions are raised",
    "by foresight of the good and evill consequences, and sequels of the",
    "action whereof we Deliberate; the good or evill effect thereof",
    "dependeth on the foresight of a long chain of consequences,",
    "of which very seldome any man is able to see to the end. But for so",
    "far as a man seeth, if the Good in those consequences be greater",
    "than the evill, the whole chain is that which Writers call Apparent",
    "or Seeming Good. And contrarily, when the evill exceedeth the good,",
    "the whole is Apparent or Seeming Evill: so that he who hath by Experience,",
    "or Reason, the greatest and surest prospect of Consequences,",
    "Deliberates best himself; and is able, when he will, to give the",
    "best counsel unto others.",
    "Felicity",
    "Continual Successe in obtaining those things which a man from",
    "time to time desireth, that is to say, continual prospering,",
    "is that men call FELICITY; I mean the Felicity of this life.",
    "For there is no such thing as perpetual Tranquillity of mind,",
    "while we live here; because Life itself is but Motion, and can never",
    "be without Desire, nor without Feare, no more than without Sense.",
    "What kind of Felicity God hath ordained to them that devoutly honour him,",
    "a man shall no sooner know, than enjoy; being joys, that now are",
    "as incomprehensible, as the word of School-men, Beatifical Vision,",
    "is unintelligible.",
    "Praise Magnification",
    "The form of speech whereby men signifie their opinion of the Goodnesse",
    "of anything is PRAISE. That whereby they signifie the power and",
    "greatness of anything is MAGNIFYING. And that whereby they signifie the",
    "opinion they have of a man's felicity is by the Greeks called",
    "Makarismos, for which we have no name in our tongue. And thus much",
    "is sufficient for the present purpose to have been said of the",
    "passions.",
    "Of all Discourse, governed by desire of Knowledge, there is at last",
    "an End, either by attaining, or by giving over. And in the chain of",
    "Discourse, wheresoever it be interrupted, there is an End for that time.",
    "Judgement, or Sentence Final",
    "Doubt",
    "If the Discourse be meerly Mentall, it consisteth of thoughts",
    "that the thing will be, and will not be; or that it has been,",
    "and has not been, alternately. So that wheresoever you break off",
    "the chayn of a mans Discourse, you leave him in a Praesumption",
    "of It Will Be, or, It Will Not Be; or it Has Been, or, Has Not Been.",
    "All which is Opinion. And that which is alternate Appetite,",
    "in Deliberating concerning Good and Evil, the same is alternate",
    "Opinion in the Enquiry of the truth of Past, and Future.",
    "And as the last Appetite in Deliberation is called the Will,",
    "so the last Opinion in search of the truth of Past, and Future,",
    "is called the JUDGEMENT, or Resolute and Final Sentence of him",
    "that Discourseth. And as the whole chain of Appetites alternate,",
    "in the question of Good or Bad is called Deliberation; so the whole",
    "chain of Opinions alternate, in the question of True, or False",
    "is called DOUBT.",
    "No Discourse whatsoever, can End in absolute knowledge of Fact,",
    "past, or to come. For, as for the knowledge of Fact, it is originally,",
    "Sense; and ever after, Memory. And for the knowledge of consequence,",
    "which I have said before is called Science, it is not Absolute,",
    "but Conditionall. No man can know by Discourse, that this, or that,",
    "is, has been, or will be; which is to know absolutely: but onely, that",
    "if This be, That is; if This has been, That has been; if This shall be,",
    "That shall be: which is to know conditionally; and that not the",
    "consequence of one thing to another; but of one name of a thing,",
    "to another name of the same thing.",
    "Science Opinion Conscience",
    "And therefore, when the Discourse is put into Speech, and begins",
    "with the Definitions of Words, and proceeds by Connexion of the same",
    "into general Affirmations, and of these again into Syllogismes,",
    "the end or last sum is called the Conclusion; and the thought",
    "of the mind by it signified is that conditional Knowledge,",
    "or Knowledge of the consequence of words, which is commonly called Science.",
    "But if the first ground of such Discourse be not Definitions,",
    "or if the Definitions be not rightly joyned together into Syllogismes,",
    "then the End or Conclusion is again OPINION, namely of the truth",
    "of somewhat said, though sometimes in absurd and senslesse words,",
    "without possibility of being understood. When two, or more men,",
    "know of one and the same fact, they are said to be CONSCIOUS of it",
    "one to another; which is as much as to know it together.",
    "And because such are fittest witnesses of the facts of one another,",
    "or of a third, it was, and ever will be reputed a very Evill act,",
    "for any man to speak against his Conscience; or to corrupt or force",
    "another so to do: Insomuch that the plea of Conscience, has been always",
    "hearkened unto very diligently in all times. Afterwards, men made use",
    "of the same word metaphorically, for the knowledge of their own",
    "secret facts, and secret thoughts; and therefore it is Rhetorically",
    "said that the Conscience is a thousand witnesses. And last of all,",
    "men, vehemently in love with their own new opinions, (though never",
    "so absurd,) and obstinately bent to maintain them, gave those",
    "their opinions also that reverenced name of Conscience, as if they",
    "would have it seem unlawful, to change or speak against them;",
    "and so pretend to know they are true, when they know at most",
    "but that they think so.",
    "Beliefe Faith",
    "When a mans Discourse beginneth not at Definitions, it beginneth",
    "either at some other contemplation of his own, and then it is still",
    "called Opinion; Or it beginneth at some saying of another,",
    "of whose ability to know the truth, and of whose honesty in not deceiving,",
    "he doubteth not; and then the Discourse is not so much concerning",
    "the Thing, as the Person; And the Resolution is called BELEEFE, and FAITH:",
    "Faith, In the man; Beleefe, both Of the man, and Of the truth of",
    "what he sayes. So then in Beleefe are two opinions; one of",
    "the saying of the man; the other of his vertue. To Have Faith In,",
    "or Trust To, or Beleeve A Man, signifie the same thing; namely,",
    "an opinion of the veracity of the man: But to Beleeve What Is Said,",
    "signifieth onely an opinion of the truth of the saying. But wee are",
    "to observe that this Phrase, I Beleeve In; as also the Latine, Credo In;",
    "and the Greek, Pisteno Eis, are never used but in the writings",
    "of Divines. In stead of them, in other writings are put, I Beleeve Him;",
    "I Have Faith In Him; I Rely On Him: and in Latin, Credo Illi; Fido Illi:",
    "and in Greek, Pisteno Anto: and that this singularity of the",
    "Ecclesiastical use of the word hath raised many disputes about the",
    "right object of the Christian Faith.",
    "But by Beleeving In, as it is in the Creed, is meant, not trust",
    "in the Person; but Confession and acknowledgement of the Doctrine.",
    "For not onely Christians, but all manner of men do so believe in God,",
    "as to hold all for truth they heare him say, whether they understand it,",
    "or not; which is all the Faith and trust can possibly be had in any",
    "person whatsoever: But they do not all believe the Doctrine of the Creed.",
    "From whence we may inferre, that when wee believe any saying",
    "whatsoever it be, to be true, from arguments taken, not from",
    "the thing it selfe, or from the principles of naturall Reason,",
